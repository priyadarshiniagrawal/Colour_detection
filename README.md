# Colour_detection
We have built unsupervised machine learning project, color detection for determining colors on images using OpenCv library

Prerequisites

Dataset:-: CSV FILE Colors are made up of 3 primary colors; red, green, and blue. In computers, we define each color value within a range of 0 to 255. So in how many ways we can define a color? The answer is 256256256 = 16,581,375. There are approximately 16.5 million different ways to represent a color. In our dataset, we need to map each colorâ€™s values with their corresponding names. We used dataset that contains RGB values with their corresponding names. The colors.csv file includes 865 color names along with their RGB and hex values.

Libraries:-:

OpenCV, Pandas are the Python packages that are necessary for this project in Python. pandas is used for listing the data of the dataset. OpenCV is the huge open-source library for the computer vision, machine learning, and image processing and now it plays a major role in real-time operation which is very important in today's systems

Images:-:

We used three images for testing this project.
